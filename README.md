=======

It's a simple project project to contribute and help with Android Developers in all levels. My idea it's create a simple app without business layer using open source libraries to demonstrate important features in mobile development.

It's possible to you find some bugs in my code, please, give me a feedback about it, I'm not the best developer in the world, I'll think that it's a good opportunity to improve my programming skills.

## Features
At the moment, we've:

1. Binding with Butterknife
2. Material design with our Toolbar
3. Toolbar with Window Translucent Status
4. Circle Image View like profile image in Gmail App
5. Floating Action Button and Menu
6. OpenStreetMap Android

### Installation and Usage
Clone this code, open your Android Studio and play ;)

### Requirements
At the moment, Android 15+.
