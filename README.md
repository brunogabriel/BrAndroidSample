=======

It's a simple project project to contribute and help with Android Developers in all levels. My idea it's create a simple app without business layer using open source libraries to demonstrate important features in mobile development.

It's possible to you find some bugs in my code, please, give me a feedback about it, I'm not the best developer in the world, I'll think that it's a good opportunity to improve my programming skills.

## Features
In development
